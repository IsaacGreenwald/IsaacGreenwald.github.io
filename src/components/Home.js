        I am a senior at Colorado College studying computer science and statistics. For my senior thesis, I created an analytical dashboard for 
        the Colorado College AI Taskforce showing how students are using AI in CC classes. Additionally, I completed a ten week REU at Montana State University
        investigating the capabilities of the packet sniffing system Snort. I am currently looking for work in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, 
        machine learning and data science. In my free time, I love rock climbing, photography, spending time in the darkroom, and skiing.
